Draw an SVG of a great white shark in profile. Show countershading: dark gray dorsal surface, white underside. Include five distinct gill slits, a crescent-shaped caudal fin with larger upper lobe, triangular serrated teeth visible, and a lateral line. Pectoral fins angled slightly downward. Add remora fish beneath. Background suggests a shipwreck silhouette and light rays from above.
