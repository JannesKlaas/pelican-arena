Produce an SVG of a common octopus investigating a glass jar on the seafloor. Depict eight arms clearly, each with double rows of suckers varying in size. The mantle is rounded, eyes forward-facing with horizontal pupils. Beak hidden beneath arms. One arm should reach into the jar’s mouth, glass reflecting highlights. Add sand ripples, scattered shells, and soft caustic light.
