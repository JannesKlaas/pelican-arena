Illustrate an 1890s surgical amphitheatre with precise anatomy yet restrained depiction (viewBox 0 0 2000 1200). Tiered seating uses concentric arcs; riser height 180 mm; tread depth 280 mm. Gas lamps at 3200K create warm top lighting; add feDropShadow for soft penumbrae. On the table, model the upper limb with accurate proportions: humerus ≈ 19% of body height, forearm ≈ 15%; scapular plane angled 30° relative to frontal. Show tendons and muscular origin/insertions schematically (low saturation, no gore), labeled via leader lines with marker-end arrows. Instruments (bone saw, forceps) reflect cool highlights; use non-scaling-stroke for etching. Perspective: single-point, horizon y=950, VP at (1000,950). Include chalk diagrams on slate as white text-on-path curves. Require glass glare simulated by clipped specular streaks.
