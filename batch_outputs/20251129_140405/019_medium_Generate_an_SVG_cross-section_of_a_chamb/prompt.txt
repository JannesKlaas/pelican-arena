Generate an SVG cross-section of a chambered nautilus. Show a precise logarithmic spiral shell divided by septa into chambers, with a central siphuncle running through them. The living chamber near the opening contains the animal: hood, eye, and numerous slender tentacles extending outward. Include fine shell ribbing and subtle pearlescent shading. Background should suggest water with gentle gradient bands.
