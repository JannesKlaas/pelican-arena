Inside a late-15th-century Florentine workshop (viewBox 0 0 2000 1200), stage a camera obscura projecting a sunlit street onto a 500x700 mm poplar panel (scaled 1px=1mm). Two-point perspective: horizon y=700; vanishing points at (-2500,700) and (4500,700). Place an apprentice referenced at 7.5 heads tall; head = 1/7.5 of body; elbow at waist; hands = 1/10 of height. Sun at 35° elev, 20° azimuth; use feSpecularLighting with fePointLight matching window coords. Paper notes in mirror-script as textPath on a spiral spline. Oak workbench uses patternUnits='userSpaceOnUse' wood grain, clipped with mask for wear. Metal compasses reflect via feColorMatrix cool highlights; quill nibs use marker-end. Require chiaroscuro via layered radial gradients and cast shadows consistent with vanishing geometry.
