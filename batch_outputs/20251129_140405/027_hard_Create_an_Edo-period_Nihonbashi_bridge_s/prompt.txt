Create an Edo-period Nihonbashi bridge scene rendered as a woodblock-print-style SVG with a disguised modern drone-kite (viewBox 0 0 2100 1200). Limit palette to 12 flat hues; emulate woodgrain/paper with feTurbulence masked noise. Perspective: low horizon y=780; VP at (1050,780). Bridge arch follows catenary y=a cosh(x/a) with a scaled to 220 px rise over 1600 px span. Kimono patterns respect era-appropriate motifs (seigaiha, asanoha) on pattern fills aligned to body contours. The drone masquerades as a kite: bamboo frame strokes, but faint rotor disks suggested by radial-gradient blur rings (no motion lines crossing the frame). Simulate registration misalignment by offsetting cyan/magenta plates by 1–2 px. River ripples: repeated paths with slight random jitter. Include kanji signage using textPath along noren.
