Nighttime natural history museum diorama featuring a Smilodon skeleton and reflective terrazzo floor (viewBox 0 0 2000 1200). Skeleton proportions: canine length ≈ 28 cm, skull length ≈ 30 cm, scapula tall 22 cm; 7 lumbar vertebrae; tail short. Mount rods discretely under mandible and pelvis. Moonlight at 15° right casts cool beams through skylight; dust shafts via masked gradients. Floor reflection uses feDisplacementMap with subtle noise to suggest polish imperfections; intensity drops with distance. Wall plaque microtext 2.2 mm cap height (scale correctly); red security LED with faint bloom. Include janitor silhouette mopping, reflection aligned. Perspective: horizon y=900; VP at (1000,900). Ensure occlusion ordering of ribs, shadows across plinth, and parallax separation of backdrop painting layers.
