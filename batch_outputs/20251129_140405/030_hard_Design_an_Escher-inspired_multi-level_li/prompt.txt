Design an Escher-inspired multi-level library that blends 3-point perspective with isometric illusions (viewBox 0 0 2200 1400). Vertical vanishing point at (1100,-2600); horizontals at (-4200,700) and (6400,700). Stairs invert gradients at landings to force perceptual flips; railings maintain constant stroke via vector-effect='non-scaling-stroke'. Shelves: book spines 240 mm tall standard; occasional folios 380 mm; pack ratios realistic. Central brass orrery: planetary radii proportional (not scale distances), with Saturn’s ring ellipticity correct for 35° tilt via skew transform; highlights via feSpecularLighting. Scholars from distinct eras (Togas, abayas, frock coats) reading by green-shaded lamps at 3000K. Latin and Greek quotes as text-on-path along helices. Require cast shadows coherent to all three VPs, and impossible connections hidden by precise layer clipping.
