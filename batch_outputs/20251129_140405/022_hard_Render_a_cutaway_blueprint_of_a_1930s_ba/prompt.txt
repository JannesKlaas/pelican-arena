Render a cutaway blueprint of a 1930s bathysphere mid-dive, mixing orthographic overlays with perspective (viewBox 0 0 1800 1200). Pressure hull radius 1500 mm (scale 1px=2mm); wall thickness 38 mm; fused-silica viewport 300 mm diameter, 90 mm thick. Internals: winch drum 800 mm OD, 4:1 gearing; crank links 250 mm center-to-center; gauge needle 60 mm, pivot at true center. Outside, bioluminescent siphonophores use animated stroke-dasharray illusions; water caustics via feTurbulence+feDisplacementMap. Rivets are a symbol reused 240 times with precise polar placement. Lighting: diver’s lamp at 15°, 2300K; apply feSpecularLighting with feSpotLight through the window. Annotate stresses with text-on-path arcs. Simulate condensation as layered blur+morphology droplets; ensure refraction offsets align with viewport curvature.
