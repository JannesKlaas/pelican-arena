Compose a Baroque still life: silver ewer, glass goblet (n≈1.52), peeled lemon, grapes, and velvet drape (viewBox 0 0 1800 1200). Candlelight 1800K at 25° left; add feSpecularLighting with fePointLight, Fresnel-like rim via layered radial gradients. Silverware reflects scene geometry; simulate environment by pre-baked gradient maps and subtle feColorMatrix hue shifts. Lemon peel curls 3 mm thick, 18 mm wide; pith rendered with noise mask. Goblet refraction distorts a vertical grid behind; ensure displacement magnitude matches glass thickness. Dew on grapes as repeated symbols with specular hotspots; micro-scratches via fine stroke-dasharray. Velvet uses a directional anisotropic sheen (approximate with gradient along fiber direction). Tablecloth damask pattern tiled with patternUnits='userSpaceOnUse'. Require shadow color bleed and occlusion contacts correctly layered.
