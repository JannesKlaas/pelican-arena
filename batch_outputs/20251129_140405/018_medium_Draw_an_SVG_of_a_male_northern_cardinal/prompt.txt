Draw an SVG of a male northern cardinal perched on a thin branch. Show the raised crest, thick conical orange beak, and black facial mask around the bill and throat. Feathers should layer: primaries, secondaries, and coverts. Tail slightly fanned. Feet anisodactyl—three toes forward, one back—gripping the branch. Include subtle feather barbs and bark texture; background muted.
