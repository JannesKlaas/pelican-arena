Create an SVG of a medieval trebuchet in side view. Show a sturdy triangular frame, axle at the apex, and an asymmetrical throwing arm with a longer projectile side. Include a hinged sling holding a stone, a heavy box counterweight, and taut ropes. The release pin angles the sling for ~45° launch. Ground planks, pegs, and shadows must align consistently.
