Generate an SVG of a praying mantis on a dew-covered leaf. Show a triangular head with two large compound eyes and a flexible neck. The raptorial forelegs must be folded, displaying spines. Include six clearly segmented legs (coxa, femur, tibia, tarsus). Add semi-transparent veined wings, a slender segmented abdomen, and antennae. Position it in three-quarter view with soft bokeh background gradients.
