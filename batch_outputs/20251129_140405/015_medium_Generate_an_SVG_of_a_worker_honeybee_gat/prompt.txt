Generate an SVG of a worker honeybee gathering pollen from a sunflower head. Show three body segments (head, thorax, abdomen) with fuzzy thorax hairs. Include two pairs of transparent veined wings, six legs with visible tarsi, and pollen baskets (corbiculae) laden on hind legs. The proboscis should contact florets. Sunflower disc displays spiral phyllotaxis; leaves serrated; stems slightly rough.
