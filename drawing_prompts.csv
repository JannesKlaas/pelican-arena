Pointed arches spring at 1/3 height; rib vaults cross at 2/3 span. Rose window radius 4.5 m; tracery follows 12-fold symmetry; stained glass panels narrate the Tetramorph with iconography accurate to 13th-century France. Two-point perspective: horizon y=620; VPs at (-3000,620) and (5200,620). Sun at 12° elevation west; colored caustics from glass via feColorMatrix spectral split and soft masks on dust rays.
